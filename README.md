# SmartLightingMIP

The idea to develop this project was aimed at decreasing the graph of production of electricity vs the demand of electricity. Our project presents the idea of efficient usage of electricity for lighting systems in residential areas. Through the means of our developed model, we aim to save power consumption by 35-40%. We are able to come up with a model of automated lighting systems that are turned on or off depending on the presence of any person in its vicinity. Along with this, we have also developed an app that allows us to control the lights inside homes from anywhere around the world. Due to this control through the app and automated system, the operational as well as maintenance costs are reduced by a large value. Thereby, making our prototype more useful for preserving the electricity for future generations.
